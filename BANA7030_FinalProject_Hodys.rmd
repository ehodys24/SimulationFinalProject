### Project Description

Conducted a simulation study on the Wendy's Driver thru near my home from my car in the parking lot. This restaurant
gets flooded with customers at night, especially on weekends and there are long queues outside the
restaurant. Customers' waiting timeis quite high on these timings, also some customers leave the queues
without taking service due to the long waiting times. In this study, I was planning to see if adding a server
at the peak timings would help reduce customer waiting time significantly and thereby help restaurant
serve more customers and make more profit. But after my conversation with the manager of the
restaurant, I came to know that adding one more server just to reduce customers' waiting time is not a
beneficial option for the restaurant as they will need to pay the additional server. But after the close
observation of the system, I realized that some customers decide their order after arriving at the counter,
mainly due to unavailability of menu (Though menu is available on the screen it is very inconvenient to
read it from a distance). Also,those customers who come in groups discuss their order after reaching to
an order counter, which consumes a lot of time and other customers have to spend more time waiting in
queue. In this study, I have analyzed two scenarios:

1) 'Original'scenario:Where some percentage of customers decide their orders after arriving at the
counter
2) 'Whatif' scenario: Where customers have already decided their orders
