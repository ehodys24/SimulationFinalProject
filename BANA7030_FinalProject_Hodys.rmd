## Final Project {.tabset}

### Project Description

Given the current situation of the pandemic, it was difficult to find a way to collect data safely for an actual problem during normal "life". So instead I chose to collect data and model a problem I observed at the fast-food drive thru restaurants in my town.  I wanted to provide evidence via modelling in Arena to justify the cost of implementating a second outdoor menu and ordering lane to improve drive thru efficiency. 

I collected the observations below while monitoring the drive-thru lane at my local Wendy's while sitting in my car in the parking lot.  This is a single lane ordering, single menu, 2 service window restaurant that was operating only a single window for payment and food.  The table below doesnt have any metadata for the observations that they were captured over a few different days for different time periods whenever I needed to leave to shope for essential goods.

Goal was to figure out
a. The average time in system
b. The average waiting time in queue

Analysis output shows the  Gamma and Weibull distributions have the smallest squared error.

All p-values greater than .015.  Gamma is slightly higher so it was chosen
